# Eat Your Bizarre Burger
Make a burger, powered by express &amp; handlebars!

## What It Is
This is a simple Express/NodeJS powered application using a MySQL database, and Handlebars to style it.

## What It Does
You begin with three default burgers. What else can you do but eat them, by clicking on the relevant fork/knife button. Once you eat it, it moves over into the 'eaten' column. Once they are eaten, you are no longer able to eat them. Because they been eatened.

## Adding Burgs
Simply type in a burger type (Chicken Burger, Ridiculous Burger, Actually a Pizza, etc) in the "add a burger" field. It is populated as uneaten! And now, you may eat!

## Cleaning Your Plate
After eating like 10 burgers, you will have a big column of burgs remaining on the side. Nobody wants that. Clicking the "Clean Up" button will remove all eaten burgers...permanently! From the page as well as the table.
